**Problem Description**

One challenge that came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic was the development of a comprehensive, multifactor risk analysis of businesses across the United States. As with many risk analytic challenges, a comprehensive, multifactor risk analysis of businesses was quickly forgotten about after the pandemic was declared as being over. However, as recent wildfires and hurricanes have shown the risks have not subsided, and for small businesses identifying their natural disaster-related risk is beyond their means. Currently, a single source for multifactor risk analysis is not available for all businesses across the United States. 

Project Goals

1) Build a multifactor risk analysis tool for businesses that can compare risk from natural disasters and manmade disasters. 

2) Develop an interactive US map that shows risk patterns.
